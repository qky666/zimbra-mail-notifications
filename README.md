# zimbra-mail-notifications
Browser extension that allows you to get notified when new mail arrives to your Zimbra account.

For this extension to work properly you must be previously logged in your Zimbra server from the browser.
Note: Newer Zimbra versions show notifications without this extension. If you use an older version, this extension might be useful for you.
